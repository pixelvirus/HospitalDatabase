Our Hospital Database application allows hospital staff to view and update records related to doctors, patients, procedures, medication and room bookings. In addition they can produce reports for several common requirements.

Run HospitalDatabase.java to use the full functionality through an interactive console. Run main.GuiEntryPoint.java to use the GUI (note that the GUI does not have all the functionality that the console version provides).
